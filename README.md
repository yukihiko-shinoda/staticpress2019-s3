## Frequently Asked Questions

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-trailing-punctuation -->
### Why mime type of file in S3 is not correct?
<!-- markdownlint-enable no-trailing-punctuation -->

This plugin uses [magic file](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/393288/explain-please-what-is-a-magic-file-in-unix) to detect mime type.
If mime type is not correct, you can specify different magic file from default by using environment variable `MAGIC`.

### What is [Put Object ACL] in StaticPress2019 Options form for?

It's just for backward compatibility. New user shouldn't use it:

[Disabling ACLs for all new buckets and enforcing Object Ownership - Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ensure-object-ownership.html)

Updated user may need to use it. According to the old specifications, StaticPress2019-S3 put object ACL when upload static file to S3.
