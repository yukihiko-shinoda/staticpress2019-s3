= Why mime type of file in S3 is not correct? =

This plugin uses [magic file](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/393288/explain-please-what-is-a-magic-file-in-unix) to detect mime type.
If mime type is not correct, you can specify different magic file from default by using environment variable "MAGIC".
